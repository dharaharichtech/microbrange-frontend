        "At Microb Range Pvt. Ltd., sustainability is at the heart of everything we do. As a biotechnology-driven company, we believe that scientific innovation must serve both people and the planet. Through our two core brands—Ever Vital and Orium—we address some of the most pressing global challenges, including malnutrition, environmental pollution, and the need for sustainable biotech infrastructure. Ever Vital focuses on delivering clean, non-GMO, plant-based and microalgae-derived nutraceuticals that are designed to combat nutritional deficiencies across large range of age groups. These formulations are accessible, affordable, and aimed at supporting immune health, daily wellness, and overall vitality, aligning closely with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 3 (Good Health and Well-being).",
        "Our commitment to sustainability extends beyond human health into environmental responsibility. Through Orium, we develop patented, compact photobioreactor systems and algae-based air purification devices that not only reduce indoor pollution but also contribute to carbon capture—supporting SDG 13 (Climate Action). These systems are energy-efficient and designed to operate with minimal environmental impact, making them ideal for urban, commercial, and research spaces. ",
        "Ethical innovation drives our R&D, with all products undergoing stringent biological evaluations, microbial testing, and heavy metal screening to ensure safety and transparency. We actively collaborate with sustainable vendors, research institutions, and mission-driven organizations to build an ecosystem that fosters innovation while preserving natural resources.

        "At Microb Range Pvt. Ltd., we believe that innovation in biotechnology should not come at a premium cost to society. Affordability is a core principle embedded in our mission to make health and sustainability universally accessible. Through our nutraceutical brand Ever Vital, we formulate high-quality, plant-based, and microalgae-derived supplements that offer comprehensive nutritional support at a fraction of the cost of conventional wellness products. By utilizing cost-effective, sustainable raw materials like Spirulina, plant-based collagen, and natural vitamin sources, we ensure our products remain both potent and economical. Our all-in-one sachet formulation reduces the need for multiple supplements, further decreasing cost and complexity for end users.",
        "We understand the diverse economic backgrounds of our customers, especially in emerging markets where nutritional gaps are widespread but resources are limited. That’s why our pricing model is designed to ensure maximum value without compromising safety, quality, or efficacy. Additionally, we’re exploring public health collaborations and NGO partnerships to make our solutions available to underserved populations.",
        "In the case of Orium, our biotech instrumentation brand, we’ve designed compact and modular photobioreactor systems and algae-based air purifiers that are significantly more affordable than traditional systems. These are optimized for low maintenance and energy consumption, making them accessible to educational institutions, startups, and urban homes. At Microb Range, affordability is not just a pricing strategy—it’s a commitment to inclusivity, health equity, and responsible innovation for all.",
